  <h2>Pool Types</h2>
</center>
    <p>Wihin swimming, there are two types of pools: long course meters pools and short course yards pools. It is possible to swim
    in both of these pools, as well as compete. However, different people use different pools. For the Olympic Games, a long course
    pool is used. For college swimming, a short course pool is used. A short course pool is 25 yards long, while a long course pool
    is 50 meters long-nearly double the size of a short course pool.
