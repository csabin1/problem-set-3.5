  <h2>Pool Types</h2>
</center>
    <p>Wihin swimming, there are two types of pools: long course meters pools and short course yards pools. It is possible to swim
    in both of these pools, as well as compete. However, different people use different pools. For the Olympic Games, a long course
    pool is used. A long course pool is more fit for the Olympic games because it gives less advantage to swimmers due to 
      the fact that there are less walls. Taller athletes have an advantage over shorter ones at this point, since they can
      get to the wall quicker. Along with that, swimmers who are good at turns and underwater swimming also have an advatage. 
      For college swimming, a short course pool is used. A short course pool is 25 yards long, while a long course pool
    is 50 meters long-nearly double the size of a short course pool. Colleges are based in short course mostly due to the fact that
      most colleges have short course pools. Since long course pools are 50 meters, they require more space for them to be 
      implemented. Most colleges do not have that space, but they do have enough space for 25 yard pools. Rather than going to 
      the same college over and over just to use their long course pool, colleges have the opportunity to go to many different
      pools and see how it is there.

  THere are hundreds, if nt thousands, of short course pools within the US. Since there are many colleges per state, there
  are also mutliple pools per state. Builing a short course pool requires a lot of money, time, and resources. Pools cannot
  be built overnight, but rather over an extended period of time. Colleges spend a lot of money to build and operate a pool, 
  and there are a variety of facilities out there. However, the best facilities are not necessarily the most costly or 
  luxurious ones, but rather based on pool and overall quality. A list of the states that have the well-known short course pools are listed below:
</p>
<ul align="center">
  <li><p>Texas</p></li>
  <li><p>California</p></li>
  <li><p>Georgia</p></li>
</ul>

Long course pools tend to be more focused in arenas or aquatic centers. While there are colleges out there who do have 
  long course pools, most do not. Therefore, companies can sponsor the building of a long course pool and get the pool
   named after them. As more important swim meets are held at long course pools, the faciltiies that host these meets
  need to be top notch-not only in the way it is built but in what it offers as well. Facilities like these cannot
  be small-they must have the room that is needed to hold a large audience number. A list of the states that have well-known long course pools are listed below:
</p>
<ul align="center">
  <li><p>North Carolina</p></li>
  <li><p>Ohio</p></li>
  <li><p>Florida</p></li>
</ul>
